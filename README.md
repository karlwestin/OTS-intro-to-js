### What is JavaScript, and Why do we write it?

This pres. is about what js is, and what we can do with it. The 'how' is hopefully gonna be what we do the rest of the day.

### First JS, Netscape 2.0

JavaScript has traditionally been a language to make changes on web pages, running in Web Browsers, like for example Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer. 

The first browser running JS came in 1995, and it was Netscape 2. 

At this point JS is used for playing a little animation when you click a link, and effects like that. Pretty soon, someone invents the Pop-Up window. There's a notion that spam and destruction is pretty much what you can do with JS, and developers hate it.

### Things got betterâ€¦

Slowly slowly this was about to change. Around the year 2000, we got the XMLHttpRequest, which is a way of sending and getting data without re-loading the page. This was pretty important, cause connection speeds were pretty slow still.

In the mid-2000's there was an effort to try to even out all the differences between browsers, so all the new features could be used. Libraries like Prototype, Dojo and jQuery were starting to make development a little nicer.

At the same time there was an effort to standardize web interfaces. Before this, 
the state of web affairs was pretty much that there was Internet Explorer, they did what they wanted. Netscape had gone bust, but now the rests of netscape re-formed as mozilla and started bringing the web together.

Late 2000's people started writing Javascript on the server. 

### Today's webapps

Google Mail and Google Maps were early big javascript apps. They were at the beginning of the "fat client" trend we see today, where you write a server that has a bunch of endpoints, and all the buildup of ui and decisions around that are made on the client.

### JS in desktop apps

Also many desktop apps are created with JavaScript. Spotify's user interface is basically a Chrome browser. Streaming and playing are handled by things built in other languages, but everything you see, everything clickable and so is HTML, CSS and JS.

### JS on the Server

Today server apps, databases and all kind of stuff is built in JS. The fact that you can build your entire app, frontend and backend in JS, has done a lot to gain more interest in the language.

### Only language that runs in web browsers

So know that we know what we can do with JS, let's look at why we should learn that over something else.

It's still, almost 20 years later, the only language that runs in web browsers. So if we want to write web applications, we need to do it.

### Console Demo

* show the console, how to open it in both FF and Chrome, 
* demonstrate that you can dive into any web app and start messing around

### Community

One reason to choose JS over other languages is that there's a giant community that shares what they build, and the we can re-use, and stand on the shoulder of giants to build cool stuff. 

NPM and Bower are package managers, where you can find and install other peoples code.
jQuery, D3 and Angular are popular libraries, that developers use to write apps.
One recent trend is that the tools we use to write JS are written in JS themselves, Atom, Brackets and Lighttable are examples of this.

### Get Started

So now to get you started, find this page, and look for the class "JavaScript day 1"
